	<p>As I am studying at LCC, I understand how important the real hand-in work experience matters.
	<br>
	I want to expose myself to a wider range of opportunities in the future,
	<br>
	and that is why I would like to receive valueable work experience before I graduate.

	<p>Thus, along with the completed class projects, I develop in the direction of teaching English as a second language.
	<br>
	I am fluent in English since I was living in an English speaking country for a significant part of my life.
	<br>
	Currently, I am working remotely as an English teacher at SkyEng.
	<br>
	I am also going to spend a summer in the USA to work on a summer job as a part of Work and Travel USA program.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Finally, I am open to any other opportunities and suggestions as I am considering every posibility!
